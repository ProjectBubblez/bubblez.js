## Development Commit
This commit is an in development commit, this is not a release version and not meant for use in production.
Using this commit should not cause any issues but not everything is ready for production use.
More issues can occur then is normally expected and some features might not be running 100%.

## Important remove note!
In update 1.1.0 bubblez.js switched from returning objects to returning classes.
The client class was named without a capital which isn't the standard for naming classes.
The old client (without a capital c) was first deprecated but is now removed entirely.  
  
Also the getTokenUser method has been removed since the token user information is now stored in (Client).user
If you need to fetch this data from the api use (Client).user.update()  
  
Some values have been removed since they were deprecated by the bubblez api.
The next values are now removed:  
(User).ban  
(User).last_posted  
(Reply).deleted
